Journal Assignment for CS 210 Week 8. 

### Reflection
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - This assignment includes a text document that includes six cities and their corresponding average yearly temperatures in Fahrenheit. This project aims to utilize this text document by reading its contents, converting the temperature data to Celsius, and writing the converted data to its own file.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   - I excelled in this project’s organization. Each task is neatly divided into three distinct methods, each dedicated to performing its respective task with clarity. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   - I encountered challenges with efficiency, often stemming from gaps in knowledge, experience, or both. It’s important to me to learn how to better implement concise coding practices that prioritize efficiency.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - My primary struggle was the brainstorming phase of outlining this program. I opted for the solution using the three methods, each tasked with a specific function. When met with problem-solving scenarios, I tend to overthink and inadvertently complicate the solution. Despite these challenges, I was able to navigate through the assignment demonstrating aptitude for organization. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   - This assignment provided valuable practice in overcoming my tendency to overthink and complicate solutions unnecessarily. Mastering techniques for reading from and writing to filers will help me tackle tasks throughout my educational journey and future career endeavors.
  
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - Using meaningful variable names and sticking to consistent formatting throughout the assignment enhances the readability of the program. Modularizing the tasks into smaller, reusable methods facilitates easier maintenance and testing. Avoiding the use of hardcoded values keeps a program adaptable. However, in this assignment, hardcoded values were exclusively used within the method responsible for converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius, following the provided formula.
